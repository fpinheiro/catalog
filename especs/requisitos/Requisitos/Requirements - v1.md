To create a solution that will let their catalog accessible for their target and potential costumers can definitely be
an effective way to raise their sales and possibly answer the costumers's doubts about the establishment and it's products.
 
## Solution
Develop an application to make commercial establishments' products catalog available in mobile devices.

## Product Overview

The application will be developed for the Android system, and it's main focus will be smartphones.

### Assumptions and Dependencies

## Features

### Register Catalog

This feature allows the registration of an establishment's catalog.

The registration will be done manually by the project manager together with the establishment owner, that should supply
the required material so that the catalog can be built.

The catalog's registration will be represented by a xml file containing it's tree structure, and an image folder
containing its products images.

#### Main Flow

1. Prepare the catalog's structure together with the establishment owner.
2. Build the xml file containing the catalog's structure.
3. Gather the required material with the establishment owner.
4. Create the image folder.
5. Compress the xml file together with the image folder in zip format.

#### XML structure

The xml will have the following structure:
	
	<xml ...>
	<catalog>
		<title>t√≠tulo</title>
		<category>
			<name>categoria1</name>
			<item>
				<name>nome1</name>
				<photo>nome1.jpg</photo>
				<description>description1...</description>
			</item>
		</category>
		<category>
			<name>categoria2</name>
			<category>
				<name>categoria3</name>
				<item>
					<name>nome3</name>
					<photo>nome3.jpg</photo>
					<description>description3...</description>
				</item>
			</category>
			<item>
				<name>nome2</name>
				<photo>nome2.jpg</photo>
				<description>description2...</description>

	</catalog>

In other words, each category contains several items or yet other categories.
